USER FEEDBACK
===


1) click and drag boxes on map editor
	It would be awesome if users could have more customizabilty options with the map editor. We can easily add new tools which help the user create more blocks.

2) more feedback on character editor
	Buttons that don't work should tell the user why it doesn't work. Features should light up when they're selected - for example when animations are created, the user should know which one is currently selected. Opportunities for crashes should be limited.

3) scroll bar
	The scroll bar should be more intuitive across the board. It should automatically populate and create buttons that the user can easily access. Also, tying with the previous fedback, it should make sure to let the user know what is currently selected.

4) the user needs more guidance. a quick textbox explaining what to do would be extremely helpful, especially for people who have never worked with sprite sheets before. Also, allowing the user to input custom boxes for the dimensions of the sprites and animations.
