===
We plan to complete this project by working on a basic implementation of the game that supports two characters, one map, and a basic physics engine for the midpoint demo. We will be primarily working within our assigned roles and will communicate with others when needed. We will then try to flesh out the features and make them as extensible as possible after the midpoint demo.
